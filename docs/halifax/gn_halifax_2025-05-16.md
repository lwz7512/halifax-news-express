**Keywords:** n, s, kids, resume, scoured, disappearance, search, area, missing, weeks, rcmp, children, ground, air, return, operation, teams, road, public, pink, fresh, rescue, originally, long, weekend, lilly, jack, reported, gairloch, lansdowne, station, previously, evidence, didn’t, day

**Summary:** Police say they will return to an area they’ve already scoured to launch a fresh search and rescue operation in their efforts to find two children who have been missing in Nova Scotia for two weeks.
Ground and air teams will return to a specific area near where the children originally went missing to search over the long weekend, according to the RCMP.
The force said its ground and air teams would return to a previously searched area for a fresh operation.
The RCMP announced it would be relying on ground search and rescue teams, as well as air support, to focus specifically on the area of Gairloch Road in the hunt for the two children.
The search follows a large-scale air and ground search of the heavily wooded and rural area around Gariloch Road at the beginning of May.

## #6 Pregnant, brain-dead Georgia woman kept alive due to state abortion ban

**Summary:** A medically brain-dead pregnant woman in the U.S. state of Georgia is being kept alive on a ventilator until her baby can be born because removing the patient’s life support would constitute an illegal abortion based on state laws.
According to Smith’s family, her doctors said they are unable to switch off the machines keeping her alive because Georgia’s abortion laws forbid abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the fetus.
Currently, there are 12 states banning abortion at all stages of pregnancy, and three, including Georgia, prohibit it after about six weeks.
Georgia’s Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act permits abortions if the pregnancy poses a threat to the mother’s life.
But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” Newkirk told the local outlet.

**Summary:** The world juniors sexual assault trial will proceed with only the judge, after the jury was dismissed early Friday.
Former world juniors team member Tyler Steenbergen, who has not been charged, had been testifying for a second day Thursday when proceedings were halted.
Global News can now report that the judge declared a mistrial out of concern that the first jury was tainted.
A member of that jury accused Dudding of initiating a conversation while in line for lunch.
The move to a judge-only trial means the case can proceed without having to start over like it did after the mistrial was declared.

**Summary:** According to the latest report from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), April saw actual home sales fall 9.8 per cent compared to the same period in 2024.
Compared to 2024, listing prices fell an average of 3.6 per cent across Canada, and the actual sale price was down 3.9 per cent compared to April of last year.
This new data from CREA suggests the real estate market may have already seen the worst of the impacts.
“Right now we’re in the transition period between uncertainty and the certainty that this (trade war) is going to be damaging to our economy,” says Cathcart.
We’re not there yet, but certainly that’s the risk of this trade war.”

**Summary:** Nova Scotia has become the latest province to discover that offering free parking at hospitals can become a hot-button issue.
Meanwhile, Quebec has taken a more moderate approach by offering free parking for two hours and reduced rates at hospitals and clinics since 2020.
In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston’s Tory government promised free hospital parking during last fall’s election campaign.
“Right now, people are spending hundreds of dollars, even thousands, just to access care.” Burch then cited Nova Scotia’s free parking policy.
In Quebec, the provincial government dramatically reduced hospital parking rates in June 2020.

**Summary:** According to the Halifax Index 2024, from the city’s public-private economic development organization Halifax Partnership, population growth hit a record high in 2023.
However, it also meant continued and serious pressures on housing, transportation, and health care,” wrote Ian Munro, chief economist with Halifax Partnership.
According to a recent report by online marketplace, rentals.ca, the average rent in Halifax is more than $2,200.
“It falls to one per cent vacancy rate if you actually are exploring any type of affordable housing unit.
There could also be a return to war-time housing programs, including building pre-fab homes and encouraging developers to build affordable rentals.

**Summary:** Daily door-to-door letter mail delivery for individual addresses should be phased out, according to recommendations made in a report by an industrial inquiry commission that says Canada Post is “effectively insolvent” as it continues to face financial issues.
Commissioner William Kaplan laid out seven recommendations as part of his report into the ongoing dispute, which could lead to a strike or lockout as of May 22.
“My recommendations are based on my conclusion that there is a way to preserve Canada Post as a vital national institution,” Kaplan wrote.
The government had asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order workers back on the job if it agreed with then-labour minister Steven MacKinnon’s determination there was an “impasse” in negotiations.
The union also called on Canada Post to return to the bargaining table after the corporation called for a “temporary pause” earlier this week so it could focus on “preparing comprehensive proposals.”

**Summary:** Canadians who thought they had won a boat through Tim Hortons’ Roll Up to Win contest, only to be told it was a mistake will soon find out if a proposed class action lawsuit can proceed.
Last April, following the restaurant chain’s annual contest, customers who had the Tim Hortons app received an email recapping the prizes they’d won during the contest.
But some customers received an email that told them they won a fishing boat and trailer worth $55,000 as part of the contest.
He added that his client who spurred the lawsuit wasn’t specifically interested in the money but in getting what he was told he won.
Tim Hortons, after the suit was put forward, said it believes the lawsuit has no merit and will address it through the court.

## #1 How posting theories about 2 missing N.S. kids online could land you in legal trouble

**Keywords:** n, s, kids, land, trouble, online, missing, posting, legal, theories, harris, posts, media, rcmp, information, parents, lot, children, public, disappearance, dylan, harassment, family, trusted, global, search, children’s, nova, social, case, images, action, it’s, sources, mother

**Summary:** A Canadian lawyer says there could be legal implications for those posting unsubstantiated theories online about the two missing children from Nova Scotia.
Some posts online include blaming the parents and suggesting they had something to do with their disappearance, pitting the parents against each other, claiming the children are alive, among other theories.
Harris was involved in the case of three-year-old Dylan Ehler, whose parents took legal action over online harassment in the disappearance of their son from Truro, N.S.
The parents said within hours of their son going missing they were met with an onslaught of cyber bullying and harassment.
So that tends to foster rumours online,” Harris said.
