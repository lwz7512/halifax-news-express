**Summary:** Nova Scotians have lost trust in the province’s largest electric utility, provincial politicians said Wednesday during a heated committee meeting that raised tough questions about the recent ransomware attack on Nova Scotia Power.
Members of the public accounts committee grilled Nova Scotia Power CEO Peter Gregg and two other senior staff members, asking them how the breach happened and what the company will do to protect ratepayers from financial harm.
Still, Chender pressed utility executives to explain why Nova Scotia Power continues to store the full social insurance numbers it had previously collected.
He said Nova Scotia Power’s cybersecurity insurance would likely cover many expenses, but he said the utility doesn’t yet know the cost of the breach.
“There is no trust with Nova Scotia Power right now,” Mombourquette said after the meeting.

**Summary:** Premier David Eby says he won’t be throwing his support behind a new oil pipeline through the province, dismissing Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s suggestion that Eby would change his mind.
Eby says in response to Ford’s remarks on Monday that the publicly-owned TMX pipeline is already running through B.C., and the province doesn’t support lifting the ban on oil tankers off British Columbia’s northern coast.
He says it’s not his job to tell Ford it’s “extremely unlikely” there will be a tunnel under Toronto’s Highway 401, or tell Alberta Premier Danielle Smith her “vision” for a pipeline connecting Alberta and northern B.C.
Story continues below advertisement Eby says his job instead is to protect the interests of British Columbia by bringing forward “shovel-ready” projects.
Eby was speaking Tuesday from Osaka, Japan, on a 10-day trade mission in Asia, and deputy premier Niki Sharma represented B.C.

## #4 Carney calls U.S. 50% steel, aluminum tariffs ‘illegal’

**Summary:** Prime Minister Mark Carney called U.S. President Donald Trump‘s doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports “illegal,” and said the federal government would take “some time” to consider its next steps.
“The latest tariffs on steel and aluminum are unjustified, they’re illegal, they’re bad for American workers, bad for American industry, and of course for Canadian industry as well,” Carney said.
Canada’s steel and aluminum industries have warned that doubling the rate would have damaging impacts for producers and the North American supply chains.
“The steel and aluminum tariffs will apply only to the steel and aluminum contents of imported products, whereas the non-steel and non-aluminum contents of imported products will be subject to other applicable tariffs,” the White House said in reference to other countries.
Canadian industry leaders have warned that North American supply chains could face “unrecoverable consequences” if the higher tariffs remain in place.

**Summary:** The province is working to expand cell coverage for Nova Scotians living in communities without access, and it also wants to prevent dropped calls and signal gaps along the province’s major highways.
The province’s cell expansion program launched in October 2023 and is rolling out in phases.
This represents a substantial accomplishment just 18 months after the program launched,” said Paul LaFleche, Department of Public Works Executive Deputy Minister.
The government has faced pressure in recent years around the lack of cell coverage in rural communities during emergencies.
Then, the goal of Phase 2 is to close remaining gaps in coverage with 27 new provincially-owned communications towers.

He has since been charged with first-degree murder and remains in custody.

**Summary:** A popular Nova Scotia farm and museum that came under fire on social media last month over concerns around the animals’ welfare now says improvements have been made.
Ross Farm Museum in New Ross, N.S., operates as a living heritage site — giving visitors a glimpse of what life was like in the 1800s.
Its executive director, Marc Tassé, says it’s hard to balance its preservation with the installation of modern amenities.
So that balance between history and modern standards has been something that we’ve been working on rebalancing,” said Tassé.
In response, Tassé says the museum is now focused on assuring the public the horses will be well care for when they return.

**Summary:** A Hants County, N.S., resident who planned a weekend meeting to discuss uranium mining in the area says residents in attendance voiced concerns about potential environmental and health harms and a lack of government consultation.

The locations are: an 80-hectare site in Louisville in Pictou County; a 64-hectare site in East Dalhousie in Annapolis County; and a 2,300-hectare site in Millet Brook in Hants County.
Some of these speakers voiced concerns that uranium exploration could result in potential water contamination or exposure to radon gas and radioactive dust.
The Nova Scotia Assembly of Mi’kmaw Chiefs has repeatedly voiced concerns about government’s lack of consultation with its communities as Nova Scotia pushes to develop natural resources.

**Summary:** Interest rates in Canada are staying put for now, after the Bank of Canada held its monetary policy steady on Wednesday.
The benchmark, or overnight, lending rate stands at 2.75 per cent, and represents the floor level of interest off of which banks can base their “prime” rate.
“The Bank’s preferred measures of core inflation, as well as other measures of underlying inflation, moved up in April,” said Macklem.
For those Canadians that may be waiting on the sidelines to purchase a home, it may not be worth waiting for interest rates to drop further to apply for a mortgage.
The May CPI report will be released on June 24, and the next interest rate announcement from the Bank of Canada comes on July 30.

## #2 U.S. ‘can’t fight a war’ without American steel, Trump tariff chief says

**Summary:** U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Wednesday defended the doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs by claiming the United States “can’t fight a war” without domestic production of those materials.
“If you don’t have the ability to make your own steel and aluminum, you can’t fight a war, and that is what the president’s doing.
In her exchange with Lutnick, Shaheen highlighted concerns from a ball bearing manufacturer in her state that supplies the U.S. aerospace industry.
“We have to have a steel industry that’s ready for American defence.” U.S. defence and aerospace manufacturers have relied on Canadian steel and aluminum for decades — including in wartime.
To this day, Canadian steel and aluminum is used to build American aircraft, missiles, space technologies and other equipment.

**Summary:** New Democrat MPs are set to vote against the government’s throne speech Wednesday, interim NDP Leader Don Davies said.
If the government loses a confidence vote, it’s defeated — which could lead to a snap election.
Davies said that while Canadians don’t want an election right now, his party is taking a “principled approach.” “It’s a clear message that this throne speech is not a worker-centric throne speech,” he said.
“We can’t support a throne speech that so badly misses the mark in terms of the economic and social policies that people need in this country.” MacKinnon said before the Liberal caucus meeting on Wednesday that the caucus is confident the throne speech will pass.
In the House of Commons Wednesday, during a debate on the reply to the throne speech, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said she will vote in favour of the speech.
