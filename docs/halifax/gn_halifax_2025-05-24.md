**Summary:** Some Maritime-based sports teams are reconsidering their travel plans amid tensions between Canada and the U.S. Trevor Walter, the coach of the Haliblaze and Halifax West high school basketball team, says they initially had American travel plans but ultimately chose to change them.
Meanwhile, other coaches are choosing to go ahead with their routine trips south of the border.
Trevor Wamback is with the Highlanders Baseball at King’s-Edgehill School in Windsor, N.S.
When the team’s spring season started, however, Wamback did contemplate cancelling some games from their schedule to add more Canadian games.
“And at the end of the day, it’s just about providing opportunity for our players.” For more on this story, watch the video above.

Between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024, 25 suspects were accused of 83 terrorism-related charges, “representing a 488% increase,” the RCMP wrote.
The RCMP package identified violent extremism as a “hot issue,” along with foreign interference, hate crimes, the Canada-U.S. border and opioids.
The government’s demands on the RCMP have “stretched the organization beyond its current capabilities and capacity,” the briefing warned the minister.
“Violent extremism is on the rise worldwide and constitutes a prominent national security threat,” the RCMP told the minister.

**Summary:** Canada Post workers won’t be heading to a picket line just yet, but the union representing them says it’s still taking strike action by calling for a ban on overtime.
The Crown corporation is warning that the move could lead to delays.
The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) advised members late Thursday night that it had called for a nationwide overtime ban starting at midnight eastern on Friday.
“At this time, there are no rotating strikes or national work stoppage.” Collective agreements between Canada Post and CUPW expired on Thursday, with the union having issued a 72-hour strike notice to the Crown corporation on Monday.
This would be a compounded increase of 13.59 per cent over four years, Canada Post said in a statement on Wednesday.

The result reverses the first tally of the ballots after the April 28 election, which had Germain ahead by 12 votes.
Rowe’s win gives the Conservatives 144 seats in the House of Commons, and brings the Liberals down to 169, which is three seats shy of the threshold for a majority government.
The opposition party now holds three of the seven federal seats in Newfoundland and Labrador.
It was one of four called after the election last month, and it was the last to produce a decision.
