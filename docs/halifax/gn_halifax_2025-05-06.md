**Summary:** The massive search for two missing children continues for a fifth day in a rural area of Nova Scotia’s Pictou County.
Since then, upwards of 160 people have been scouring the wooded area on land with search dogs and in the air with helicopters and drones.
The multi-agency effort received some extra boots on the ground Tuesday, as some of New Brunswick’s search and rescue teams answered the call to help.
In an interview yesterday, the children’s stepfather, Daniel Martell, said he was calling for the search area to be expanded to include provincial borders and airports in case the children were abducted.
Community members, like Daniel Roode of the Northeastern Nova Scotia Salvation Army, say when one family’s children go missing, the concern is felt by all.

**Summary:** Nova Scotia has confirmed a case of measles in the Halifax Regional Municipality — the first case in the province since 2023.
The outbreaks prompted Nova Scotia to hold measles vaccination clinics to inoculate those who may be missing a dose or were unsure of their vaccination status.
In Nova Scotia, people born 1970 to 1995 were offered one dose of measles vaccine as children.
Those born in 1996 or later were offered two doses of measles vaccine but should get fully vaccinated now if they missed one or both doses.
People born in 1969 or earlier are generally considered immune but can consider receiving a single dose of measles vaccine if travelling outside of Canada.

## #9 Danielle Smith promises Alberta separation referendum if signatures warrant

**Summary:** Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says she would hold a referendum on provincial separation next year if citizens gather the required signatures on a petition.
They are, quite literally, our friends and neighbors who’ve just had enough of having their livelihoods and prosperity attacked by a hostile federal government,” Smith said.
“They’re frustrated, and they have every reason to be.” The speech comes a week after Smith’s United Conservative government introduced legislation that, if passed, will sharply reduce the bar petitioners need to meet to trigger a provincial referendum.
“To be clear from the outset, our government will not be putting a vote on separation from Canada on the referendum ballot,” Smith said on Monday.
“Therefore, any citizen-initiated referendum question must not violate the constitutional rights of First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples and must uphold and honour treaties 6, 7, and 8 should any referendum question ever pass.

**Summary:** Prime Minister Mark Carney told U.S. President Donald Trump that Canada is “never for sale” after the president once again mused about the U.S. taking over Canada during a high-stakes White House meeting on the future of the Canada-U.S. relationship.
“This is a bigger discussion,” Carney told reporters in the Oval Office.
He struck a positive tone despite Trump appearing unwilling to budge on his trade war and sometimes disparaging rhetoric toward Canada.
He also credited Canada for “stepping up” its military spending in recent years, which Carney has vowed to increase further.
But Trump still sought to get the final word on Canada one day becoming a U.S. state.

**Summary:** The wife of a man who sought assisted death following a disastrous emergency room stay in Quebec is accusing the healthcare system of negligence.
On Monday, Sylvie Brosseau spoke publicly as a coroner’s inquiry began into the death of her longtime partner, Normand Meunier, who died last year.
Meunier, a 66-year-old quadriplegic, spent four days on a stretcher in the emergency room at Saint-Jérôme Hospital, northwest of Montreal, in January 2024.
He developed severe pressure sores during that stay — a complication that ultimately led him to choose medically-assisted death.
“Failure to follow proper medical protocols can be the difference between life and death,” said Brosseau’s lawyer, Patrick Martin-Menard.

## #12 Nova Scotia fixed-term lease loophole to remain in place despite some abuse: official

**Authors:** The Canadian Press, globalnewsdigital

**Summary:** “Certainly we are aware anecdotally through our conversations with landlords and tenants that fixed-term leases are being used inappropriately,” O’Toole said.
Unlike a periodic lease, a fixed-term lease does not automatically renew beyond its set end date.
The provincial rent cap covers periodic leases and situations in which a landlord signs a new fixed-term lease with the same tenant, but it does not cover fixed-term leases with new tenants.
“Only two out of 243 people (surveyed) on a fixed-term lease needed a short-term rental.
The opposition NDP tabled legislation in March that would give tenants on fixed-term leases the option of extending on a month-to-month basis if they want to remain.

**Summary:** A woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by five former members of Canada’s world junior hockey team in June 2018 wanted a “wild night,” one of the players’ defence lawyers suggests.
Lawyers for the other players will also have the chance to cross-examine the complainant.
The complainant testified she gave oral sex to three men on the floor of the room, which she alleged was not consensual.
She also alleged the men made penetrative sexual comments involving golf clubs that were in the room.
Court was shown Monday text messages to the complainant from McLeod the day after the alleged incident.

**Summary:** “We are going to put more emphasis on the Canadian business.” While some Canadian companies have lost trust, those reliant on the U.S. market cannot entirely replace it, especially smaller firms, companies and industry associations have said.
Other companies are having difficult conversations with U.S. customers, several executives told Reuters.
For Natalie Gaudreault, owner of Fusion TG, a tool steel distributor, Trump’s tariffs piled up as a double whammy on her Montreal-based business.
A fifth of her sales are to the U.S. She was first hit by 25 per cent tariffs that Canada imposed on China in October.
Then came Trump’s 25 per cent tariff.
