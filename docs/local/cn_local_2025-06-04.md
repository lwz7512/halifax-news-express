That evening, the Nova Scotia premier took to social media, saying his government is in the process of licensing five gigawatts of offshore wind energy.
“Right now, Nova Scotia is on the edge of a clean energy breakthrough,” he said in the video.
According to the premier, the province only uses about 2.4 gigawatts of energy at peak demand, meaning the remaining energy could be used elsewhere in the country.
In the video, the premier said he supports Carney’s vision for the country to be a big player in the energy sector.
