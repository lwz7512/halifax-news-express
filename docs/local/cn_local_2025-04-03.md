**Summary:** The Halifax Regional Municipality has issued a clarification to information provided to CityNews Halifax regarding the demolition of the vacant Bloomfield school site.
On Wednesday, a municipal spokesperson told CityNews that the municipality would be covering the cost of demolition at the site, which includes three derelict buildings and is owned by BANC Group.
In a statement Thursday, the municipality now says there was a miscommunication, and Halifax will only be footing the bill for the demolition of one of the buildings that was significantly damaged by fire in February.
“Following its initial response to the fire at one of the three buildings at the Bloomfield site on Feb. 16, 2025, Halifax RegionalFire & Emergency (HRFE), pursuant to the Fire Safety Act, installed temporary fencing and established security at the site for public safety,” the municipality’s statement reads.
The municipality now says a demolition permit issued on March 11, 2025, is for the two remaining structures, and the property owner will be responsible for any costs associated with that work.

**Summary:** Almost two years after wildfires destroyed 200 structures, including 151 homes, in the western suburbs of Halifax, residents are anxious about the city’s slow progress in creating more ways for them to flee if the flames return.
Buckland and other residents in nearby communities who were interviewed by The Canadian Press say further changes are needed.
She predicted that if fires reached her area, both exits would likely be blocked by blazes, and the main road would be gridlocked.
Davies contacted the Halifax regional council for education, which told her they’d bring her suggestions forward to Halifax’s Emergency Management Office.
The council sent letters to the city’s emergency office last January, but Davies said she’s had no response to her ideas.
