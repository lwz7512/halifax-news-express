**Summary:** Halifax Water says it has submitted a rate application seeking significant increases in residential water bills.
The utility is asking the provincial regulator for a 16.2 per cent increase in average residential bills in 2025-26 and a 17.6 per cent increase in 2026-27.
The ask comes as Halifax Water says it’s facing significant operating deficits projected to be $18.7 million for 2024-25 and $34.1 million for 2025-26.
The utility is attributing those challenges to issues including inflation, rising interest rates and aging infrastructure.
“Over the past several years, the utility has used accumulated reserves and surpluses to keep rates lower,” it said in a statement on its website.

**Summary:** The Nova Scotia government says a larger fine for illegal burning that was brought in after the province’s destructive 2023 wildfires will be sticking around.
The province set an interim fine of $25,000 for people who refused to follow daily burn restrictions, up from the previous fine which was around $200.
We imposed the $25,000 fine through temporary means to show we mean business, and it’s working – we had the quietest wildfire season on record last year,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources.
Burning is never allowed between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. as that is when the risk for wildfires is greatest, according to government.
The province says when you factor in a victim fine surcharge and court costs, the total fine now amounts to $28,872.50.
