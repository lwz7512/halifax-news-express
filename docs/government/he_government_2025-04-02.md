**Summary:** On Tuesday, the Nova Scotia minimum wage went up by 50 cents to $15.70/hour.
$15.70 can also buy you six loaves of bread at Dollarama.
So, the price of gas today is 146.5 per litre, so $15.70 will get you 10.72 litres.
The price of diesel is now 161.2 per litre, so $15.70 will get you 9.74 litres.
So you have to work just under six hours at $15.70 to pay for your monthly bus pass.

## The institution is not more important than its mission: what child sex abuse and American universities teach us about dealing with fascism

**Authors:** Tim Bousquet, Suzanne Rent, Jennifer Henderson, Madiha Mughees, Joan Baxter

**Keywords:** important, mission, child, sex, abuse, american, universities, teach, dealing, fascism, institution, conservative, ndp, ppc, green, liberal, foulds, halifax, university, wage, cbc, click, nova, scotia, allowed, it’s, don’t, examiner, minimum, issues, institutions, abuser, trumpists, send, item

**Summary:** Institutions tend to take on a life of their own, such that the institution becomes more important than its purpose or the people who make it up.
The most sickening example is when schools, churches, and sports teams are confronted with the reality of a sexual abuser.
The institution was created to shepherd young people into fulsome adulthood, but because the institution was all about self-preservation, survivors spend much of their adulthood coming to terms with their abuse.
I suppose I started down this train of thought because Joella Foulds’ experience with the CBC made me step back and contemplate the Halifax Examiner.
As Yvette d’Entremont reported in August, the living wage in Halifax is now $28.30.
