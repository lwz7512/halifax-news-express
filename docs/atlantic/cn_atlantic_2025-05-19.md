Halifax (0-3-1) is last in the NSL standings and still seeking its first victory of the league’s inaugural campaign.
Toronto held 51 per cent of possession with a 10-7 edge in shot attempts, including 4-2 on target.

**Summary:** MAIN BROOK — Breanna Bromley-Clarke may be the sole graduate of her all-grades school on Newfoundland’s Northern Peninsula, but her prom helped bring many in her community together.
Its vibrant colour shone as Bromley-Clarke delivered her valedictory address at the Mary Simms All-Grade School in Main Brook.
In some ways, her event in the community five hours drive north of Corner Brook, N.L., was similar to graduations at larger schools across the province.
She proceeded to the gym, which was fully decorated, and roughly 85 guests sat down to a delicious meal.
“I’ve always felt, and will always have, a sense of pride in my school and community, even though it’s small,” she said.

**Summary:** The province was tied with New Brunswick for the highest rate of children living in food-insecure households among the provinces in 2024, and Langdon, the president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers’ Association, says his members are witnessing this first hand.
Newfoundland and Labrador had the third-highest rate of overall food insecurity among the provinces, behind Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The group’s report prompted anti-poverty non-profit Food First Newfoundland and Labrador to call on the provincial government to re-examine its poverty-reduction strategies.
The provincial government needs to take food insecurity seriously and assemble a team to find solutions, Seward said.
“For single-parent families, the summer is the most critical time of the year for food insecurity,” she said.

**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — A long weekend looms with no decision yet in a federal election vote recount in the central Newfoundland riding of Terra Nova–The Peninsulas.
The judicial recount began Monday in Marystown, N.L., a community of about 5,200 people about 200 kilometres southwest of the provincial capital of St. John’s.
It was triggered automatically when the initial final tally of the votes cast in the April 28 election showed Liberal Anthony Germain ahead of Conservative Jonathan Rowe by just 12 votes.
Elections Canada officials have said all votes cast in the riding – more than 41,000 – have been recounted.
The recount is one of two in progress in the country – elections officials are also reviewing ballots cast in the Ontario riding of Milton East–Halton Hills South.

## #2 'Sullivan's Crossing' is a 'life-preserver in tumultuous times': Canadian showrunner

**Summary:** TORONTO — For Roma Roth, setting her show “Sullivan’s Crossing” in Nova Scotia is a way to showcase more of Canada on the small screen.
In the U.S, “Sullivan’s Crossing” airs on the CW.
She said she sees “Sullivan’s Crossing” as an “evergreen” comfort watch and is happy to leave the characters untouched by current politics.
“Sullivan’s Crossing is a Canadian series and didn’t involve any struck companies so it is disheartening to see a union that is supposed to protect its members turning on its own,” she said Saturday in an emailed statement.
It’s also a “spicy season,” Roth said, adding viewers can expect to see Maggie and Cal’s relationship heating up and some new characters being introduced.
