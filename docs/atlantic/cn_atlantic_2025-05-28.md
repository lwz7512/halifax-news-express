**Summary:** Rob Lantz said in a letter to federal Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland that bridge and ferry tolls are seen as a significant trade barrier, increasing everyday costs.
The Confederation Bridge stretches across 12.9-kilometres, and is billed as Canada’s longest flyover.
Transport Canada spokeswoman Sau Sau Liu said in an email the annual traffic on the Confederation Bridge is about 990,000 vehicles.
Northumberland Ferries is headquartered in Charlottetown and operates ferry services between the three Maritime provinces and Maine.
“That’s why we’re making the Confederation Bridge, Northumberland and Marine Atlantic, and the Coopérative de Transport Maritime et Aérien Ferries more affordable.

**Summary:** HALIFAX — Halifax Regional Municipality is closing one of its five remaining homeless encampment sites.
Max Chauvin, Halifax’s director of housing and homelessness, says the Geary Street site has consistently had the lowest use among the designated encampments.
As of Friday, Halifax staff observed four tents at the Geary Street site, and 47 tents and four trailers across the municipality’s four other designated encampment locations, he says.
Chauvin says in the coming days, the residents sleeping at the Geary Street site will be offered resources and support to move to a shelter, temporary housing or one of the remaining designated encampment sites.
Four designated homeless encampment sites will remain open; three in Halifax and one in Dartmouth.

**Summary:** Nova Scotia’s deputy minister of natural resources says private landowners whose property has been identified for potential uranium exploration can say no.
Karen Gatien told reporters Tuesday that letters are being sent to property owners in three selected areas, and the government hopes there will at least be conversations about possible exploration.
The provincial government added uranium to its list of priority critical minerals earlier this month and issued a request for exploration proposals at three sites it says have known deposits of the heavy metal.
Each of the three sites is on private land, and Natural Resources Minister Tory Rushton has said the government would begin talks with the landowners about possible exploration.
There were fishing communities, farming communities, forestry communities, mining communities,” Houston said.

## #7 Moscovitch's drama 'Red Like Fruit' explores power and memory in post-#MeToo era

**Summary:** There’s rich significance, she suggests, in bringing her latest meditation on gender and power to a renowned Toronto theatre company once inextricably linked to allegations of sexual misconduct.
The celebrated playwright points out that “Red Like Fruit” hits Soulpepper several years after its co-founder and artistic director Albert Schultz resigned amid allegations of impropriety dating back years.
“They’re trying to combat their own legacy,” Moscovitch says of being presented by Soulpepper, in collaboration with the Luminato Festival.
Such familiarity is especially handy in directing “Red Like Fruit,” he says, recalling multiple conversations with Moscovitch about her own eureka moments over past encounters.
Is that trauma or is that experience?” “Red Like Fruit” begins with a preview Wednesday and opens Thursday.

**Summary:** HALIFAX — The Nova Scotia government has opted against laying charges in relation to the origins of a 2023 wildfire in the western suburbs of Halifax.
The Department of Natural Resources says in a release today that it had up to two years to lay charges under the Forests Act, but it had determined there isn’t sufficient evidence to secure a conviction.
In the release, the department also says there is a “high bar” for what can be used as evidence in court in these cases.
Last December, an RCMP investigation determined no criminality in the cause of the wildfire, and the file was passed to the province.
Last August, Natural Resources Minister Tory Rushton said investigators knew the location of the original fire but needed more evidence to lay charges.

**Summary:** A celebrated Swedish-Canadian archeologist who helped unravel the story of the Vikings at the only acknowledged Norse site in North America has died.
Birgitta Wallace Ferguson discovered evidence that Leif Eriksson’s Vinland was briefly established at L’Anse aux Meadows, at the tip of Newfoundland’s Great Northern Peninsula.
Robert Ferguson, her husband and fellow archeologist, says she was passionately devoted to her work and the L’Anse aux Meadows site, where she felt a deep connection with the local community.
Adjunct archeology professor Shannon Lewis-Simpson says though Wallace Ferguson was a titan in her field, she was known for being modest, kind and generous with her time and expertise.
Wallace died last week in Halifax while in hospital.

**Summary:** HALIFAX — RCMP in northeastern Nova Scotia confirmed that two children who disappeared almost four weeks ago were last seen in public with family members on May 1 — the day before they were reported missing.
“Based on the details we’ve gathered so far, we’ve confirmed that Lilly and Jack were observed in public with family members on the afternoon of May 1,” Nova Scotia RCMP major crime unit Cpl.
Police said in the statement they are asking the public for more video footage from the area to help with their investigation.
Police have repeatedly said there is no evidence to suggest the children were abducted.
On May 7, the search was scaled back as the RCMP announced there was little chance the siblings could have survived in the woods for that long.
