**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — An advocate for victims of clergy abuse said Saturday they are holding on to cautious hope about Pope Leo XIV, but keeping a close eye on recently surfaced allegations that he previously sheltered those accused of abuse.
Newfoundlander Gemma Hickey, the board president of Ending Clergy Abuse, was in Rome this week to push for the church to adopt a zero-tolerance policy for clergy abuse.
“You can’t be married and be a priest,” Hickey said.
But some advocates, including Pedro Salinas, a founding member of Ending Clergy Abuse, credit Prevost with supporting survivors of an abusive, Peru-based Catholic movement that was eventually dissolved by the late Pope Francis.
“I would hope that this pope is courageous enough to lead, because people are starved for that right now,” they said.

**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — Atlantic music stars Classified, Kellie Loder and Maggie Andrew emerged as top winners at this year’s East Coast Music Awards on Sunday as days worth of festivities honouring the region’s musicians wrapped up in St. John’s, N.L.
Sunday’s East Coast Music and Industry Awards ceremony included performances by St. John’s singer-songwriter Baraka, Prince Edward Island’s Noah Malcolm and Port-Aux-Poutines, the French-Canadian duo from St. John’s.
The first batch of East Coast Music Award winners were honoured at a ceremony Thursday night that began with an emotional tribute to Mark Hiscock, a beloved accordionist who died last week in St. John’s.
The East Coast Music Association ousted CEO Blanche Israel in January, prompting outcry among members who said she had meaningfully moved the needle on much-needed diversity and inclusivity.
Some claim organizers lean too heavily into folk and rock music, downplaying the region’s burgeoning community of musicians who represent other genres.
