## #1 Nova Scotia takes feds to court, saying it must protect land link

**Summary:** The Nova Scotia government argued in court today that the Canadian Government is responsible for infrastructure that protects the strip of land that links the province with New Brunswick.
The province said the federal government should pay the entire cost of upgrading the centuries-old dikes that protect the Chignecto Isthmus from flooding, a project expected to cost $650 million.
A provincial government lawyer told Nova Scotia’s Court of Appeal today that the extensive network of dikes now protect a Canadian National Railway line, the Trans-Canada Highway, buried fibre optic cables and electricity lines.
Daniel Boyle told the court that means the dikes now protect interprovincial trade and communications links, which fall under sole federal jurisdiction.
He says the federal government has an obligation to protect those links, which are increasingly threatened by flooding caused by more fierce and frequent storms and rising sea levels.

**Summary:** TORONTO — For Roma Roth, setting her show “Sullivan’s Crossing” in Nova Scotia is a way to showcase more of Canada on the small screen.
In the U.S, “Sullivan’s Crossing” airs on the CW.
She said she sees “Sullivan’s Crossing” as an “evergreen” comfort watch and is happy to leave the characters untouched by current politics.
“Sullivan’s Crossing is a Canadian series and didn’t involve any struck companies so it is disheartening to see a union that is supposed to protect its members turning on its own,” she said Saturday in an emailed statement.
It’s also a “spicy season,” Roth said, adding viewers can expect to see Maggie and Cal’s relationship heating up and some new characters being introduced.

## #3 P.E.I. First Nation says fisheries officers seized 300 Indigenous lobster traps

**Summary:** MALPEQUE BAY — A First Nation in Prince Edward Island says it plans to take the Canadian government to court after alleging federal fisheries officers seized 300 lobster traps belonging to Indigenous fishers.
We’re prepared to defend that, and we’ll defend it in court,” Bernard said in an interview Monday.
A spokesperson with Fisheries and Oceans Canada did not confirm the seizures, saying only that Ottawa has authorized 1,000 lobster traps for Lennox Island First Nation fishers for the 2025 season.
The success of the First Nation’s treaty fishery has directly supported the young families of Lennox Island’s 15 lobster fishers, Bernard said.
When Bernard got confirmation that lobster traps had been seized Sunday, she said she emailed her contact at Oceans and Fisheries Canada to demand that they be returned.

**Summary:** The Nova Scotia government will begin covering the cost of the shingles vaccine as of May 28 for residents aged 65 and older.
Premier Tim Houston says residents can start booking appointments today for the shots, fulfilling a promise he made during the campaign leading up to his Nov. 26 re-election.
The premier says he’s hopeful the vaccination program projected to cost $26 million in its first year will help reduce the painful symptoms of the illness in older Nova Scotians.
The Health Department says the cost of two doses of vaccine is about $400 — too high for some seniors who want to receive them.
Nearly one in three Canadians will be affected by shingles, a viral infection that can cause painful, burning skin rashes and nerve pain.
