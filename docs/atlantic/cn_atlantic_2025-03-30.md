**Summary:** The rise of artificial intelligence has kicked off an arms race between perpetrators and police in Canada.
It’s a case study in how AI technology can be used by police to rapidly sift large volumes of evidence — surveillance footage, criminal records, or hard drives — to identify patterns and potential threats.
Toronto police admitted that same year that some of its officers used the same facial recognition software without informing their chief.
That means “bias from false arrests from facial recognition technology” and the “historical bias of where police have patrolled and the arrests they’ve made,” she said.
The federal government’s Artificial Intelligence and Data Act was tabled in 2022, but died when Parliament was prorogued on Jan. 6.

**Summary:** A new report co-authored by a Canadian researcher warns that more than one-fifth of pollinator species it studied in North America are at risk of extinction.
The study noted that pollinators provide more than $15 billion worth of food each year in North America.
Among the insect pollinators, extinction risks were highest with bees.
Out of 472 species of bees studied in Canada and the U.S., 34.7 per cent were at risk of extinction.
Flower flies and beetles are relatively secure from extinction, but all three pollinating bat species are at risk of extinction.

**Summary:** Nova Scotia’s lucrative seafood industry is bracing for market upheaval as it deals with the effects of tariffs imposed by China and awaits an identical 25 per cent duty from the United States.
China’s tariffs on Canadian seafood took effect March 20, while the U.S. duties are expected to kick in on Wednesday.
According to the federal government, China is Canada’s second largest fish and seafood export market after the U.S., with $1.3 billion in products shipped to the Asian nation in 2024.
Lobster alone accounted for $541.8 million in exports to the U.S. and $458.7 million to China.
Other significant seafood exports from the province include scallop, halibut, clams, shrimp and sea cucumber, a niche product that primarily goes to China.

**Summary:** “It’s impossible to annex Canada without violence,” said Ahmad, who has advised generals at the Pentagon about counter-insurgency strategies.
The U.S. military would try to limit the amount of destruction and death to prevent creating a disaffected population, he said.
Meanwhile, American military historian Eliot Cohen said Canadians shouldn’t lose sleep about a U.S. invasion.
“The United States launched eight or nine invasions of Canada during the War of 1812, winning only one fruitless battle.
“Canada is a gigantic country with 40 million people who really don’t want to be Americans,” Cohen said in an interview.

**Summary:** — Education officials in Newfoundland and Labrador recently ordered the destruction of thousands of textbooks because they contained inaccurate information about the province’s Indigenous population.
The move came after the government’s Indigenous education advisory committee decided the books “did not accurately reflect the cultural reality” of the province.
As well, the committee found that the books incorrectly said that all Indigenous people are exempt from paying taxes or paying for a university education.

## Deed tax increase won't hurt demand for Nova Scotia recreational properties: Realtor

**Summary:** HALIFAX — Demand for cottages and recreational properties in Nova Scotia should remain strong despite the doubling of the province’s deed transfer tax, says an executive with a major real estate agency.
Nova Scotia’s 2025-26 budget increases the deed transfer tax for non-resident homebuyers to 10 per cent from five per cent as of April 1.
The Nova Scotia Association of Realtors opposes the increase, saying the tax will drive prospective buyers away to neighbouring provinces such as New Brunswick.
But Royal LePage says in its spring recreational property report that it expects a busy season in Nova Scotia with lower interest rates boosting buyer confidence.
“Affordable recreational properties will continue to see demand because that market is only partially driven by people who are non-residents,” Honsberger said.

In a statement, the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs says it is considering filing an injunction against the law that lifts a ban on uranium mining and exploration, and ends a moratorium on fracking.
The chiefs say the government is making decisions on unceded and traditional Mi’kmaq territory without properly consulting them.
They say they will continue to oppose hydraulic fracturing until their environmental concerns have been addressed.
Until then, we will continue to be against fracking in our territory.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2025.
