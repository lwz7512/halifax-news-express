**Summary:** The health authority in Nova Scotia says it is seeking the power to issue $500 tickets to unauthorized vehicles that take advantage of free parking at hospitals.
Nova Scotia Health emailed Halifax-area hospital staff today to say it is working to preserve spaces for patients, visitors, and authorized staff.
The message comes a day after Health Minister Michelle Thompson acknowledged “growing pains” as hospitals adjust to the province’s new free parking policy that took effect May 1.
The health authority says that until it can ticket drivers it will issue warnings to unauthorized vehicles, and offer 175 additional free on-site parking spaces to staff at the Halifax Infirmary and Victoria General Hospital.
The health authority says the Halifax Infirmary and Victoria General hospital together need almost 4,000 more parking spaces than are currently available to meet peak demand.

**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — A long weekend looms with no decision yet in a federal election vote recount in the central Newfoundland riding of Terra Nova–The Peninsulas.
The judicial recount began Monday in Marystown, N.L., a community of about 5,200 people about 200 kilometres southwest of the provincial capital of St. John’s.
It was triggered automatically when the initial final tally of the votes cast in the April 28 election showed Liberal Anthony Germain ahead of Conservative Jonathan Rowe by just 12 votes.
Elections Canada officials have said all votes cast in the riding – more than 41,000 – have been recounted.
The recount is one of two in progress in the country – elections officials are also reviewing ballots cast in the Ontario riding of Milton East–Halton Hills South.

## #5 No action against N.S. rent loophole out of fears for housing supply: minister

**Summary:** The minister responsible for Nova Scotia’s rental property rules says her department won’t crack down on instances of abuse involving fixed-term rent leases because it doesn’t want to affect the housing supply.
However, she did not specify how the housing supply would be affected, under repeated questioning by reporters.
“We have seen the misuse of fixed-term leases and it is extremely disappointing, but again our focus has always been on supply,” she said.
The provincial rent cap covers periodic leases and situations in which a landlord signs a new fixed-term lease with the same tenant, but it does not cover fixed-term leases with new tenants.
Last fall, a number of landlords defended the use of fixed-term leases before a legislature committee, saying it helped them recoup costs in the face of the government’s rent cap.

## #8 Atlantic Canada's lobster industry stung by low prices, global economic turmoil

**Summary:** Lobster harvesters in Atlantic Canada aren’t thrilled with the prices they’re getting for their catches, but experts say the recent downturn comes as no surprise due to uncertainty looming over the industry.
“Everybody is very nervous.” The association represents lobster fishers, most of them in southwestern Nova Scotia.
On March 10, China announced a 25-per-cent retaliatory tariff on Canadian seafood in response to Canadian duties imposed last fall on Chinese-made electric vehicles, steel and aluminum.
The new duties have effectively ended Canada’s $1.3-billion seafood trade with China, which happens to be Canada’s second-largest market for live lobster.
Earlier this week, U.S. and Chinese officials rolled back most of their recent tit-for-tat tariffs, which was bad news for the Canadian lobster business.

**Summary:** The province’s former Liberal government committed in September 2020 to an independent investigation of police actions in the case of Assoun, who spent 17 years in prison for the killing of his ex-girlfriend.
British Columbia’s police oversight body had taken on the investigation but dropped the case 18 months ago because it said its officers were too busy.
Nauss says in a written statement Thursday that she appreciates concerns about the delay and understands it is a matter of national importance.
“Getting this investigation started is a priority for me,” wrote Nauss.
“This is a unique and unusual circumstance and I share the public interest in ensuring this is investigated and addressed,” she said.

**Summary:** Nova Scotia’s public works minister says the province is getting $170 million from the federal government to assist with housing infrastructure, after a deal was signed last winter.
Fred Tilley says Nova Scotia signed the 10-year agreement under the Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund in February.
Tilley told reporters following a cabinet meeting that details on funding allocations will be released as the province identifies the projects it wants to support.
The minister says some of the $170 million could also be used to augment projects that can apply directly to Ottawa under a separate stream that’s part of the federal fund.
The $6 billion federal fund is aimed at accelerating housing projects by funding infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater, stormwater and solid waste.
