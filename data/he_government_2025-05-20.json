  "summary": "The cozy comeback, and a feed full of turntables Lately, my favourite form of social media is a quiet feed full of pictures of turntables, and the records they are currently playing.\nSearches for cozy mystery, cozy reading, and cozy fantasy grew 2-10x since 2022)… The world is an uncertain place, and we’re inundated with news that feels apocalyptic.\nSeveral years ago, a Facebook friend added me to something I had not known existed: a listening group.\nSo when he invited me to join his listening group, I was hesitant.\nThe application has been filed on behalf of the Nova Scotia Criminal Lawyers’ Association, the Elizabeth Fry Society of Mainland Nova Scotia, and the Mi’kmaw Legal Support Network."
