  "summary": "Mi’kmaw chiefs in Nova Scotia say they are considering legal action against newly passed provincial legislation that opens the door to hydraulic fracturing for natural gas.\nIn a statement, the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs says it is considering filing an injunction against the law that lifts a ban on uranium mining and exploration, and ends a moratorium on fracking.\nThe chiefs say the government is making decisions on unceded and traditional Mi’kmaq territory without properly consulting them.\nThey say they will continue to oppose hydraulic fracturing until their environmental concerns have been addressed.\nUntil then, we will continue to be against fracking in our territory.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2025.",
