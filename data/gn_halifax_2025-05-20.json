  "summary": "After a weekend of renewed searching for a pair of missing children in Nova Scotia, the province’s premier says the siblings’ disappearance is “weighing heavy” on the minds of people in Pictou County.\nPremier Tim Houston’s riding is in the county where six-year-old Lilly Sullivan and four-year-old Jack Sullivan were reported missing more than two weeks ago.\nThis past weekend, searchers were back out targeting specific areas around the road where the children’s home is located, said RCMP.\nThe disappearance has sparked rampant speculation on social media — much of it targeting Martell and the children’s mother.\nWhen asked if he had anything to do with the children’s disappearance, he was adamant in his answer.",
