  "summary": "Dear Minister Solomon, Congratulations on your new post as Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation.\nWhile tech companies are sinking billions into AI, there is little evidence of its effectiveness, indicating that this bubble may well burst.\nThe AI industry promotes their corporate machines as being human-like and capable of understanding, reasoning, intuiting, learning, collaborating, and creativity — a dangerous myth.\nThis continues the pattern of tech executives, who, for decades, have aggressively marketed screens and phones to schools and youth even as tech executives have strictly controlled their own children’s access to these devices.\nHer current area of research is on how the field of robotics and artificial intelligence is shaped by fiction.",
