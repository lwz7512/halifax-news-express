  "summary": "The rise of artificial intelligence has kicked off an arms race between perpetrators and police in Canada.\nIt’s a case study in how AI technology can be used by police to rapidly sift large volumes of evidence — surveillance footage, criminal records, or hard drives — to identify patterns and potential threats.\nToronto police admitted that same year that some of its officers used the same facial recognition software without informing their chief.\nThat means “bias from false arrests from facial recognition technology” and the “historical bias of where police have patrolled and the arrests they’ve made,” she said.\nThe federal government’s Artificial Intelligence and Data Act was tabled in 2022, but died when Parliament was prorogued on Jan. 6.",
