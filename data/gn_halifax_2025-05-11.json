  "summary": "As Alberta flirts with the possibility of a referendum on separation, Quebec sovereigntists are watching with interest — and a healthy dose of skepticism.\nWe’re not alike.” Last week, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith tabled legislation that would lower the bar for a citizen petition to trigger a referendum.\nStill, Alepin questioned whether Albertans who say they support independence really want to leave Canada, or whether they simply plan to use the threat as leverage.\n“Most Albertans, even those that support separation, don’t really want it,” he said.\nHe said that would be his first choice, even though it would undermine the independence movement.",
