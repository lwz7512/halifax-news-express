  "summary": "Almost two years after wildfires destroyed 200 structures, including 151 homes, in the western suburbs of Halifax, residents are anxious about the city’s slow progress in creating more ways for them to flee if the flames return.\nBuckland and other residents in nearby communities who were interviewed by The Canadian Press say further changes are needed.\nShe predicted that if fires reached her area, both exits would likely be blocked by blazes, and the main road would be gridlocked.\nDavies contacted the Halifax regional council for education, which told her they’d bring her suggestions forward to Halifax’s Emergency Management Office.\nThe council sent letters to the city’s emergency office last January, but Davies said she’s had no response to her ideas.",

Ltd., said in an emailed statement that his company also intends to seek damages for the Fisheries Department’s reductions of its elver quota.",
