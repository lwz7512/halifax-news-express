**Summary:** If I had given this two minutes of thought, I could probably have figured out my way to the post office, but instead I turned on Google Maps.
I was using the cognitive mapping/survey method to get to the post office, while Google Maps tried to pick out a route for me.
Google Maps was not helpful in this situation, but Guru Maps was.
I’ve noticed a troubling (to me) tendency to put on Google Maps when I’m going somewhere familiar.
