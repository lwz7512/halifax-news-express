**Summary:** Almost two years after wildfires destroyed 200 structures, including 151 homes, in the western suburbs of Halifax, residents are anxious about the city’s slow progress in creating more ways for them to flee if the flames return.
Buckland and other residents in nearby communities who were interviewed by The Canadian Press say further changes are needed.
She predicted that if fires reached her area, both exits would likely be blocked by blazes, and the main road would be gridlocked.
Davies contacted the Halifax regional council for education, which told her they’d bring her suggestions forward to Halifax’s Emergency Management Office.
The council sent letters to the city’s emergency office last January, but Davies said she’s had no response to her ideas.

**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — A man who says his right to vote was denied in Newfoundland and Labrador’s 2021 election will finally have his day in court.
In a decision released Wednesday, the provincial Supreme Court ordered a trial to begin in June in Whymarrh Whitby’s legal challenge of the province’s pandemic-delayed election four years ago.
It alleges election officials failed to run a vote that was fair, impartial and in compliance with provincial law.
Handrigan’s decision dismissed arguments by Chaulk’s lawyers that the suit should be declared moot because another provincial election is expected this year.
“I really appreciated that the judge understood that the evidence is there, it’s worth having a trial,” Whitby said in an interview Wednesday.

**Summary:** HALIFAX — A Federal Court judge has ruled that the Fisheries Department failed to properly consult commercial baby eel fishers when it transferred about 14 per cent of their quota to First Nations.
The March 28 ruling from Justice Paul Favel says the quota transfer for the 2023 season away from Shelburne Elver Ltd. and South Shore Trading Co. Ltd. was “procedurally unfair.” The companies had sought a judicial review of the department’s quota decision.
Favel said the federal Fisheries Department didn’t engage enough with the two commercial licence holders before it cut their quotas for the 2023 elver season without any compensation.
“The lack of engagement in advance of the 2023 season was procedurally unfair.
Mitchell Feigenbaum, president of South Shore Trading Co. Ltd., said in an emailed statement that his company also intends to seek damages for the Fisheries Department’s reductions of its elver quota.

“We can’t fish basically is what we’re saying,” Edwards said in an interview Sunday night after the encounter.
We lost the night of fishing.” Chief Michelle Glasgow of Sipekne’katik did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
“We are not regulated by your colonial commercial licensing schemes, nor do we accept your proposed management plan,” he wrote.

**Summary:** FREDERICTON — Freezing rain left trees and power lines coated and roads slick Monday morning as Environment Canada issued weather warnings for large parts of the Atlantic region.
The weather agency put most of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton and the western half of Newfoundland under freezing rain warnings.
Although there were “several hours of freezing rain,” the mercury began to climb, rendering the effects of the weather system minor in the Maritime provinces.
“The worst of the freezing rain is over.” There were 48 customers without electricity in New Brunswick on Monday morning but power was restored by the afternoon.
A combination of wind and weight from ice is what usually affects power lines, Maepea said, and this time winds remained low.

Justice Minister Becky Druhan said the shooting continues to have a serious and heartbreaking impact on the victims, their families, and the wider community.

**Summary:** Victims of domestic violence in Nova Scotia are now entitled to more paid leave under the province’s labour standards code.
As of today, paid leave for victims of family violence expands to five days from three, a move intended to give employees more time away from their jobs to seek medical, legal and social support without the added worry of lost income.
The five paid days can be used during either the 16-week leave or the 10-day leave.
The province says an estimated one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime, and it says the cost of domestic violence to the Canadian economy is estimated to be more than $7 billion annually, including lost productivity and health-care costs.
More than 10,000 Nova Scotians accessed provincial domestic violence services in the past year alone.
