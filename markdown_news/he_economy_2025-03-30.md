**Summary:** Buyout private equity firms profit massively from short-term serial investments, and then flip them, usually to another private equity firm.
A few months ago, Social Capital Partners (SCP) hosted a panel discussion that examined private equity and its harms.
Private equity differed from other businesses with incentives that drove behaviours he said were not good for democratic, progressive countries.
One is the business owners who may choose to sell to private equity buyout funds.
From one perspective, it’s better for a Canadian private equity company to own a Canadian company, in that at least they’re Canadian.

**Summary:** Halifax council adopts its budget in March of every year, with the budget year starting on April 1.
This year, Halifax council raided the library fund in order to increase the police budget.
I’ve been looking at the long history of policing in Nova Scotia, and from that research, I have two take-aways that inform the current moment.
Mi’kmaw Chiefs condemn Bill 6 Yesterday, the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs sent the above letter to Premier Tim Houston.
As a collective we need to make clear, the Mi’kmaq of Nova Scotia and the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs continue to remain opposed to hydraulic fracturing and will not see it happen in our unceded and traditional territory.
