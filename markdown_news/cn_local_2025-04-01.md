## Deed transfer tax hike won't hurt cottage demand, real estate agency says

**Authors:** Chris Halef

**Published:** 2025-03-31T00:00:00

**Keywords:** change, nova, scotia, tax, deed, transfer, hurt, cottages, properties, real, estate, province’s, increase, demand, recreational, cent, atlantic, major, agency, won’t, starting, non-resident, homebuyers, increases, previously, announced, budget, measures, hike, matt, honsberger, president, halifax, office, royal

**Summary:** A major real estate agency says the province’s move to increase the deed transfer tax won’t hurt demand for recreational properties.
Starting Tuesday, the deed transfer tax for non-resident homebuyers increases to 10 per cent from 5 per cent.
Despite the hike, Matt Honsberger, president of the Halifax office of Royal LePage Atlantic, still believes demand for cottages and recreational properties will remain strong.
He says he’s bullish on the real estate market because most waterfront properties in Atlantic Canada — which can sell for under $500,000 — are significantly cheaper than in other parts of the country.
Meanwhile, the Nova Scotia Association of Realtors opposes the increase, saying the tax will drive prospective buyers away to neighbouring provinces such as New Brunswick.

**Summary:** The union representing firefighters in the Halifax area are pulling the alarm on the dangers posed by “derelict” buildings after several fires in recent weeks.
Three fires were reported at the vacant Saint Patricks Alexandra School on Maitland Street in the north end last week, according to Halifax Professional Fire Fighters.
“Derelict buildings are not just urban decay – they are high-hazard zones.
Another vacant school property, the Bloomfield site on Agricola Street, has also seen fires recently.
The permit allows for all three buildings on the site to be torn down, he said.
