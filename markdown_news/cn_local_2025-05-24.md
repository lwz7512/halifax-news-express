“Total rainfall amounts from this initial push of weather are about 15 to 30 mm for Halifax and areas along the Atlantic coast,” he said.
“Locally, higher amounts are possible due to downpours and the presence of thunderstorms.” Wind gusts could reach up to 70 km/h today.
Conditions are expected to ease on Saturday, with lighter winds and less rain, but clouds will linger and keep daytime highs around 11 C. Sunday will be similar, with a chance of a passing shower and a high of about 13 C.

**Summary:** Experts believe that several named storms could develop this hurricane season, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will impact Atlantic Canada.
In its yearly briefing just before hurricane season is set to start next month, Environment Canada’s Bob Robichaud, a warning preparedness meteorologist, said that the number of storms expected in a year doesn’t mean more impact on Canadians.
Robichaud said that three to five of those storms are expected to become “major hurricanes.” “The peak of hurricane season is from early August until the end of October.
Factors influencing hurricane season Robichaud said that experts like him keep an eye on water temperature in the Atlantic.
Hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30.
