**Keywords:** nova, scotia, kids, 18, days, community, missing, premier, weighing, heavy, search, rcmp, weekend, children’s, martell, searching, children, siblings, disappearance, county, reported, day, renewed, minds, pictou, lilly, sullivan, jack, told, authorities, lansdowne, station, n, s, continues

**Summary:** After a weekend of renewed searching for a pair of missing children in Nova Scotia, the province’s premier says the siblings’ disappearance is “weighing heavy” on the minds of people in Pictou County.
Premier Tim Houston’s riding is in the county where six-year-old Lilly Sullivan and four-year-old Jack Sullivan were reported missing more than two weeks ago.
This past weekend, searchers were back out targeting specific areas around the road where the children’s home is located, said RCMP.
The disappearance has sparked rampant speculation on social media — much of it targeting Martell and the children’s mother.
When asked if he had anything to do with the children’s disappearance, he was adamant in his answer.

**Summary:** The Nova Scotia government will begin covering the cost of the shingles vaccine as of May 28 for residents aged 65 and older.
“The vaccine is often just out of reach financially for too many people,” Houston said.
Nearly one in three Canadians will be affected by shingles, a viral infection that can cause painful, burning skin rashes and nerve pain.
Strang said preventing the impact of shingles reduces hospital admissions and medical complications that are related to the condition’s symptoms.
They’ve seen what happened to their friends who had shingles, and how debilitating it can be,” he said.

**Summary:** Inflation in Canada dropped in April as the impact of tariffs sank in at the same time as the consumer carbon price was removed.
For many, the question in focus now is whether the Bank of Canada may actually be less inclined to cut interest rates in June than experts have been speculating.
Although the results fell roughly in-line with what most economists were predicting, not all economic and financial experts are ready to celebrate just yet.
And the Bank of Canada is targeting a one to three per cent range for inflation,” says Sheluk.
However, if core inflation is climbing, the central bank may be caught between a rock and a hard place.
