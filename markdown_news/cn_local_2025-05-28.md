**Summary:** The province says no charges will be laid in connection with the 2023 wildfire in Upper Tantallon and Hammonds Plains.
The Department of Natural Resources put out a statement on the two year anniversary of the wildfire, saying the investigation has wrapped up.
“After exhausting all possible avenues, the province is unable to lay charges in relation to the 2023 wildfire in Upper Tantallon/Hammonds Plains,” the statement said.
“The Department of Natural Resources has two years from the date of an offence to lay charges under the Forests Act.
Charges are only laid if there is sufficient evidence to secure a conviction.” The fire, which broke out May 28, 2023, burned 969 hectares, destroyed 151 homes, and forced more than 16,000 people to evacuate.

**Summary:** Halifax Regional Municipality officials say they are closing and de-designating the Geary Street green space as a designated encampment site.
Officials say several spaces are available across multiple provincially funded indoor shelters and temporary housing sites.
The city says Geary Street has seen consistently low usage over the past three years, and in recent months recorded the lowest occupancy among all designated sites.
As of May 23, the municipality recorded 51 tents and four trailers across the remaining designated sites.
Officials say the municipality will continue to phase out designated sites as more permanent shelter and housing spaces come online.

**Summary:** The RCMP in Nova Scotia says hundreds of tickets were handed out to drivers during Canada Road Safety Week in May.
According to the Mounties, between May 13 and 19, nearly 1,000 summary offence tickets were issued, primarily for distracted or aggressive driving and not wearing a seatbelt.
“As the four primary causal factors for fatal and serious injury collisions in 2024 were impaired driving, distracted driving, aggressive driving (primarily speeding), and failure to use a seatbelt, it was particularly important for officers across Nova Scotia to remind all road users about how we all play a part in keeping Nova Scotia safe,” the RCMP wrote in a media release.
In addition, 54 criminal code charges were laid for impaired operation along with 22 provincial roadside suspensions.
The RCMP says while road safety is always important, officers used road safety week to prioritize proactive and preventative interactions with the public.

**Summary:** Police are investigating a hit-and-run that took place in Fall River last week.
On Friday at roughly 10 p.m., emergency crews responded to a report of a collision near the 1400 block of Fall River Road where a Dodge Ram collided with a dirt bike travelling in the same direction.
Police said two of the three youth dirt bike riders suffered serious injuries and were transported to hospital by EHS while the third rider was uninjured.
Mounties later found the Dodge Ram at a nearby gas station and the male driver showed signs of impairment and then completed a breathlyzer test which showed he was not impaired by alcohol.
Officers then demanded that the 45-year-old man from Fletchers Lake perform a standard field sobriety test and when he refused, he was arrested.

**Summary:** Regional council is set to meet on Tuesday, and one councillor is hoping to get the ball rolling on a municipal litter strategy.
A motion from District 13 Councillor Nancy Hartling is requesting a staff report outlining a comprehensive litter strategy.
In her motion, Hartling writes that the intent is to address what she calls a “significant and often overlooked source of litter,” referring to commercial, industrial and construction-related debris.
Hartling says that public messaging often targets individuals, but much of the litter along roads and highways comes from commercial activities.
The motion asks for a report that includes a targeted litter management strategy, reasonable and sustainable bylaw enforcement for commercial and industrial sources of litter, and compelling fines for bylaw infractions.
