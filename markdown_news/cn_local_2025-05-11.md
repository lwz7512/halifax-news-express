**Summary:** Halifax Regional councillors are set to assess the viability of bringing an outdoor pickleball facility to Dartmouth.
At council on Tuesday May 13, council will vote on a motion to direct staff to identify potential locations for an outdoor pickleball facility in Dartmouth, including prospective costs and other situations.
As a result, a study completed by staff said Halifax should follow Vancouver’s approach to pickleball, adopted after lawsuits were filed against the city in 2021 and 2022 for excessive pickleball noise.
Under the Vancouver model, pickleball courts are required to be evenly distributed throughout the city and use appropriate sound barriers to keep noise levels below 50 decibels.
HRM has confirmed that the Dartmouth Pickleball Association is willing to participate financially to open the new facility.

**Summary:** Late Thursday night Halifax firefighters responded to an alarm in a high-rise building and found an active blaze.
According to the firefighters’ union, teams arrived at 11:53 p.m. at a 20-storey building on Brunswick Street in Halifax.
Officials said that multiple alarm zones were activated across the structure, prompting a second alarm to be called, requesting more resources.
After combing through the high-rise, officials found the blaze in the laundry room and were able to extinguish it quickly.
Smoke has already spread to several floors, meaning teams had to use high-powered fans to waft it out of the building before people returned back.

**Summary:** It’s been 33 years since the Westray Mine disaster rocked Nova Scotia’s Pictou County.
The takeaway from both unions and politicians is that it’s a time to remember the fight continues to ensure workers are protected.
In the days that followed, the small community was full to the brim of miners from neighbouring provinces, volunteers and media.
The rescues started immediately, but it wasn’t until several days later that they uncovered the bodies of 11 miners.
“Their memory continues to shine bright.” The disaster eventually led to the 2004 Westray Amendments, which updated the Criminal Code of Canada to allow for criminal negligence charges to be laid in workplace incidents.
