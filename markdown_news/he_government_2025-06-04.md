**Summary:** Speaking of valuing writing, it’s book awards week in Nova Scotia.
The Nova Scotia Book Awards were held last night at the Brightwood Golf & Country Club in Dartmouth (more on that in a minute) and there is a whole slew of other events this week, leading up to the Atlantic Book Awards gala on Thursday, June 5, at the Halifax Central Library.
(I sit ex officio on the board of the Writers’ Federation of Nova Scotia, which presents some of the awards, but had no direct involvement with any of the awards, presentations, or other events related to them).
She also has taught writing courses for teens, with all the participants using typewriters, and says it’s gone over great.
Churchill’s lobbying is intended to help Freeman Lumber “meet with relevant federal ministries and agencies to discuss the economic importance of the Forestry Sector in Nova Scotia,” and “the need to support forest exports to non-US markets, particularly the establishment of a new pulp mill in Nova Scotia.”… That means Churchill is lobbying on behalf of not just Freeman Lumber, but also for a coalition that includes the Nova Scotia government, for federal funding for a new pulp mill in Nova Scotia.
