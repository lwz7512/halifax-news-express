**Summary:** You see, tomorrow is the secular holiday known as Opening Day, when the Major League Baseball season opens, and I get emotional about baseball.

Ahead of opening day, I’ll leave you with one of my favourite baseball essays.
Cuttell said June 21, the day for the flypast over the Halifax Wanderers Grounds, is also National Indigenous Peoples Day.
