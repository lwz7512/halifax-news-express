**Summary:** The cozy comeback, and a feed full of turntables Lately, my favourite form of social media is a quiet feed full of pictures of turntables, and the records they are currently playing.
Searches for cozy mystery, cozy reading, and cozy fantasy grew 2-10x since 2022)… The world is an uncertain place, and we’re inundated with news that feels apocalyptic.
Several years ago, a Facebook friend added me to something I had not known existed: a listening group.
So when he invited me to join his listening group, I was hesitant.
The application has been filed on behalf of the Nova Scotia Criminal Lawyers’ Association, the Elizabeth Fry Society of Mainland Nova Scotia, and the Mi’kmaw Legal Support Network.

## There's an ethical obligation to include affordable housing in all that development happening on what used to be the Dartmouth Common

**Keywords:** ethical, obligation, include, affordable, happening, dartmouth, common, housing, development, measles, public, bridge, health, halifax, road, street, wyse, building, nova, buildings, land, site, vaccine, symptoms, park, commission, built, town, province, 12, case, school, item, release, department

**Summary:** Anyone crossing the Macdonald Bridge can plainly see there’s a development boom at the Dartmouth end of the bridge.
Was that sketchy carnival really the best use of the empty land along Wyse Road?
Or, the developers could just include a bunch of affordable housing in the Wyse Road corridor and we could stop with the theatrics already.
Another rink was built along Wyse Road, at what is now the parking lot to the Sportsplex.
Public Health said it involves a Nova Scotian who travelled to the United States.

**Summary:** According to the investigation summary, that fire was ruled accidental and there were no smoke alarms in the home.
Meldrum and Covey provided the updates on the investigations and safety advice for homeowners.
“We know smoke alarms save lives,” Meldrum said.
‘These fires stick with our firefighters’ A total of 65 firefighters responded to the fires in Lower Sackville and Dartmouth.
All fatal fires have a toll on their mental wellness, and when children are involved it’s particularly difficult,” Meldrum said.

## What is a city without parks and green spaces? Not a city you'd want to live in

**Keywords:** city, parks, green, spaces, live, park, beavers, halifax, marsh, belchers, smoke, easy, residents, wildlife, staff, places, search, arrives, hrm, area, lily, jack, sievert, removed, spoke, complaints, told, didn’t, send, item, copy, click, pictou, born, 30

**Summary:** I visit Belchers Marsh Park often and the wildlife there is a huge part of its charm and what makes it interesting.
I think Parkland Avenue, which runs along Belchers Marsh Park, was mostly woods, too.
Still, much remains, including in Belchers Marsh Park.
To its credit, Halifax does a really good job at keeping parks and green spaces.
That now includes Belchers Marsh Park.

## Nova Scotia's changes to the environmental assessment process get mixed reviews

**Summary:** Despite that lofty rhetoric, over the past five years not a single energy project has been refused or delayed under the current Class 1 process.
“These changes (to the environmental assessment process) are focused on renewable energy and clean energy,” said Halman.
That is not true… A modernized environmental assessment process is good for Nova Scotia.
“I would call it 10 extra days of shouting into the void.” McKendry said many people she has assisted have become disillusioned after engaging in the environmental assessment process.
NDP Opposition leader Claudia Chender said while there is no doubt that after nearly 20 years the Environmental Assessment process required changes, “in general we need to know there is meaningful consultation around all these projects.
