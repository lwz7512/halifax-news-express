**Summary:** Nova Scotia RCMP say the results of a renewed search for two children who went missing earlier this month “will be carefully reviewed.” The police force said in a news release Sunday that 115 volunteer searchers came out on May 18 for the second day of a renewed ground-and-air search for six-year-old Lilly Sullivan and her four-year-old brother Jack Sullivan.
The siblings were reported missing on May 2 from their home in Lansdowne Station, N.S., about 140 kilometres northeast of Halifax.
RCMP said officers and search-and-rescue teams targeted specific areas in their search, which began Saturday around the road where their home is located.
“This weekend’s search will be carefully reviewed and assessed by investigators and search managers to help in planning any further ground and air search efforts,” the force said.
The RCMP also said it searched bodies of water around Lansdowne Station on May 8 and 9 but didn’t find any trace of the children.

**Summary:** Prime Minister Mark Carney says the Liberal government plans to table a federal budget this fall.

Carney says there will be more clarity in coming months on Canada’s defence spending plans, the overall economic outlook and how to make the federal government more efficient.
Opposition parties attacked Carney earlier this week for being vague about his plans after his government said it would not table a budget before the House of Commons rises for the summer.

**Summary:** Ryan Straschnitzki’s life has been an open book since he was seriously injured in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash, and his story is soon to be shown on TV.
In July 2023, he decided to try to make the 2028 Paralympic basketball squad.
“I think at the beginning of the basketball season I kind of doubted myself a little bit.
But he also wants to be known for other things, like his pursuit of wheelchair basketball and making the Canadian Paralympic Team for the 2028 Paralympics.
He wants to be known for his Straz Strong charity that he started and some of these things that were beyond the crash.” Straschnitzki is set to be in Toronto this week promoting the series.

**Summary:** Breanna Bromley-Clarke may be the sole graduate of her all-grades school on Newfoundland’s Northern Peninsula, but her prom helped bring many in her community together.
Its vibrant colour shone as Bromley-Clarke delivered her valedictory address at the Mary Simms All-Grade School in Main Brook.
In some ways, her event in the community five hours drive north of Corner Brook, N.L., was similar to graduations at larger schools across the province.
She proceeded to the gym, which was fully decorated, and roughly 85 guests sat down to a delicious meal.
“I’ve always felt, and will always have, a sense of pride in my school and community, even though it’s small,” she said.

**Summary:** Israel has faced condemnation from the United Nations, aid groups and some European allies for its blockade of goods into the war-ravaged territory, including food, fuel and medicine.
On Sunday it said it would allow a “basic” amount of aid into Gaza to prevent a “hunger crisis” from developing.
Food experts have already warned that the blockade risked sparking famine in Gaza, a territory of roughly two million people.
Netanyahu has been under pressure from two far-right governing partners not to send aid back into Gaza.
Israel says the plan is meant to prevent Hamas from accessing aid, which Israel says it uses to bolster its rule in Gaza.

**Summary:** TORONTO – Part of John Schneider’s mission as the Toronto Blue Jays manager is to be bullish on his lineup, even when his team struggles.
“It’s been kind of one extreme or the other, but these guys will figure it out,” Schneider said.
“I think it will come together, and when it does, it’ll be a lot less stressful.” The Blue Jays (22-24) have entered the second quarter of the season only one win ahead of the 21-25 pace at the 46-game mark last year.
Santander struggles Newcomer Anthony Santander returned to the Blue Jays’ starting lineup after missing two games with what initially was described as a sore shoulder and changed to a hip ailment.
So stick with it and get back to work on Tuesday.” Breathtaking Baddoo Tigers left fielder Akil Baddoo snuffed out a Blue Jays’ opening-inning rally with two stunning catches.

**Summary:** “The next fire in here is going to be incredible,” says the former Parks Canada fire management co-ordinator, standing in the expansive Carrot Creek fire break.
The meadow was shorn more than 20 years ago by Parks Canada to slow future wildfires in their tracks before reaching Banff and Canmore.
This year, Parks Canada hired an Indigenous logging company to raze several hectares of land near Banff.
Profits of that timber will be used to maintain the land, said Jane Park, fire and vegetation specialist for Banff National Park.
Each fire break represents the start of a new ecosystem that Parks Canada will need to maintain.

**Summary:** Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, his office said Sunday.
He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone.
“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said.
Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.
When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones.
