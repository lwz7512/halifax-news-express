**Summary:** Provincial politicians took aim at Nova Scotia Power during a legislative committee meeting this morning, saying the utility owes ratepayers answers after a cybersecurity breach gave thieves access to data belonging to 280,000 customers.
The utility’s CEO and other staff were grilled by the public accounts committee about how the breach happened and what the company will do to protect its customers from financial harm.
Nova Scotia Power CEO Peter Gregg says the ransomware attack affected almost half of the utility’s customers, including 140,000 customers who had given the utility their social insurance numbers.
Chris Heck, chief digital officer with Nova Scotia Power’s parent company Emera, told the committee that the company identified unusual activity on their server on April 25, but later determined the cyber-thieves had accessed the system as early as March 19.
NDP Leader Claudia Chender pressed the two men to explain why Nova Scotia Power had been storing the social insurance numbers, but they declined to say, citing an ongoing investigation.

**Summary:** Premier Tim Houston released some details on a plan to make Nova Scotia a clean energy powerhouse in the foreseeable future, however, he did not disclose any costs.
That evening, the Nova Scotia premier took to social media, saying his government is in the process of licensing five gigawatts of offshore wind energy.
“Right now, Nova Scotia is on the edge of a clean energy breakthrough,” he said in the video.
According to the premier, the province only uses about 2.4 gigawatts of energy at peak demand, meaning the remaining energy could be used elsewhere in the country.
In the video, the premier said he supports Carney’s vision for the country to be a big player in the energy sector.

**Summary:** HALIFAX — An assessment has been ordered to determine the options for a historic schooner that’s been berthed at the site of the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic in Lunenburg, N.S.
“This will help us better understand the vessel’s condition and what work may be required,” he wrote in an email.
According to museum records, Theresa E. Connor is one of Canada’s oldest schooners, and the last to dory fish the Grand Banks out of the port of Lunenburg.
“It’s absolutely amazing, it gives you goosebumps if you’re into that sort of thing,” he said.
“It would be an amazing exhibit, and it would cost a lot less than building a new schooner,” he said.

**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — The global green hydrogen industry is lagging behind its own hype, but executives from six companies vying to build wind-powered hydrogen operations in Newfoundland and Labrador say it’s too soon give up.
And there may be a chance to supply wind power to the local grid in Newfoundland and Labrador.
The race to launch a green hydrogen industry in Canada’s easternmost province began in earnest in 2022 when Olaf Scholz, the former chancellor of Germany, visited western Newfoundland in 2022.
He signed a memorandum of understanding with former prime minister Justin Trudeau to develop a transatlantic green hydrogen corridor, with the first shipments hoped to begin this year.
The players that are left are the ones that are serious and committed.” The local green energy industry will ultimately rely largely on exports, Povisils said.

**Summary:** In the ridings of Central Newfoundland and Long Range Mountains, the average is age 49, according to Elections Canada.
Amanda Bittner, a political science professor at Memorial University in St. John’s, said anything Elections Canada can do to decrease the confusion around voting is good.
“That speaks to a gap between voter understanding of what to do and Elections Canada processes.” “Fortunately, Elections Canada takes voter turnout very seriously, and I am sure they have already made note of this issue and are working on tweaking their processes for next time,” she added.
The 62-year-old also hopes Elections Canada will try to figure out why so many ballots were cast incorrectly.
However, she hopes Elections Canada will take note of what happened and ensure it won’t happen again.

The new arrangement would end the contentious deal 16 years early and see Hydro‑Québec pay for more power while developing new projects with Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro along the Churchill River.
Some in Newfoundland and Labrador have also wondered if Hydro‑Québec can be trusted and whether the province will truly get enough value for its resources.
Newfoundland and Labrador expects to be carrying a net debt of $19.4 billion by the end of the current fiscal year.

## #4 Judge orders rethink of preservation plan for endangered piping plovers on East Coast

**Summary:** HALIFAX — A federal judge has ordered Ottawa to rethink its strategy to preserve an endangered shorebird.
Piping plovers are small shorebirds that nest primarily on sand, gravel or cobblestone beaches.
“The applicants argued that without a biology degree, the beachgoer would be unable to understand whether any particular part of the beach is indeed critical habitat,” wrote the judge.
During the trial, the federal government responded that their new system was more geographically precise and was defining critical habitat in clear, scientific terms.
There was also testimony from federal experts arguing that the wording of the recovery plan for the birds was actually intended to identify entire beaches as plover critical habitat.
