**Summary:** HALIFAX — Two commercial fishers harvesting baby eels under new federal rules say they felt they had to stop fishing on Sunday night when a large group of Indigenous harvesters arrived at the river with nets.
“We can’t fish basically is what we’re saying,” Edwards said in an interview Sunday night after the encounter.
We lost the night of fishing.” Chief Michelle Glasgow of Sipekne’katik did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
“We are not regulated by your colonial commercial licensing schemes, nor do we accept your proposed management plan,” he wrote.

**Summary:** “It’s impossible to annex Canada without violence,” said Ahmad, who has advised generals at the Pentagon about counter-insurgency strategies.
The U.S. military would try to limit the amount of destruction and death to prevent creating a disaffected population, he said.
Meanwhile, American military historian Eliot Cohen said Canadians shouldn’t lose sleep about a U.S. invasion.
“The United States launched eight or nine invasions of Canada during the War of 1812, winning only one fruitless battle.
“Canada is a gigantic country with 40 million people who really don’t want to be Americans,” Cohen said in an interview.

**Summary:** FREDERICTON — Freezing rain left trees and power lines coated and roads slick Monday morning as Environment Canada issued weather warnings for large parts of the Atlantic region.
The weather agency put most of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton and the western half of Newfoundland under freezing rain warnings.
Although there were “several hours of freezing rain,” the mercury began to climb, rendering the effects of the weather system minor in the Maritime provinces.
“The worst of the freezing rain is over.” There were 48 customers without electricity in New Brunswick on Monday morning but power was restored by the afternoon.
A combination of wind and weight from ice is what usually affects power lines, Maepea said, and this time winds remained low.

**Summary:** Victims of domestic violence in Nova Scotia are now entitled to more paid leave under the province’s labour standards code.
As of today, paid leave for victims of family violence expands to five days from three, a move intended to give employees more time away from their jobs to seek medical, legal and social support without the added worry of lost income.
The five paid days can be used during either the 16-week leave or the 10-day leave.
The province says an estimated one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime, and it says the cost of domestic violence to the Canadian economy is estimated to be more than $7 billion annually, including lost productivity and health-care costs.
More than 10,000 Nova Scotians accessed provincial domestic violence services in the past year alone.
