**Summary:** Premiers in the Atlantic region say that despite Canada being left out of the latest round of global U.S. tariffs, they need to hold the line in the face of growing economic uncertainty.
Trump also said he is going ahead with previously announced 25 per cent tariffs on automobile imports starting Thursday, which will add to existing 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.
“We will work with those who remain impacted on both an individual basis and larger-scale programming basis, as needed,” said Houston.
Houston also said retaliatory measures already taken will remain, including the review of non-essential contracts with U.S. suppliers, increased highway tolls for commercial U.S. vehicles, and the removal of American alcohol from Nova Scotia Liquor Corp. stores.
For example, officials are in conversations with countries in Asia for seafood opportunities and in Europe for other exports.

Crowds of people were in the park celebrating the 41st annual reunion of residents of Africville, the historic Black community in the north end of Halifax that was demolished in the 1960s.

## #12 Religious gathering cancelled in N.S. because of fears of U.S. border policies

**Summary:** A gathering of religious groups from across North America that was supposed to be held this year in Nova Scotia has been postponed indefinitely because of worries over U.S. border policies.
The annual conference of the North American Interfaith Network brings together people of various denominations, and the theme for this year’s meeting in Wolfville, N.S., was addressing social justice issues.
Rob Hankinson, coordinator of the conference, says that in early February he asked nearly 120 people who had planned to attend whether the policies of the Trump administration were making them reconsider travelling.
Hankinson says most responded that they were unable to commit to attending because of fears that people who were not U.S. citizens might be prevented from returning home to the U.S. from Canada.
But he says he understands why this year’s meeting was cancelled, given the concerns of some people about re-entering the U.S.

**Summary:** Almost two years after wildfires destroyed 200 structures, including 151 homes, in the western suburbs of Halifax, residents are anxious about the city’s slow progress in creating more ways for them to flee if the flames return.
Buckland and other residents in nearby communities who were interviewed by The Canadian Press say further changes are needed.
She predicted that if fires reached her area, both exits would likely be blocked by blazes, and the main road would be gridlocked.
Davies contacted the Halifax regional council for education, which told her they’d bring her suggestions forward to Halifax’s Emergency Management Office.
The council sent letters to the city’s emergency office last January, but Davies said she’s had no response to her ideas.

**Summary:** Canada is imposing counter-tariffs that will match U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on vehicles while trying to incentivize automakers to stay put and promising more aid for auto workers, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday.
Carney said the shared Canada-U.S auto sector that was created over decades since the signing of the Auto Pact in 1965 had been disrupted with Trump’s announcement.
The Prime Minister’s Office said the new counter-tariffs on the U.S. auto sector will come into force in the coming days.
“The unjustified 25 per cent tariffs on automotive, steel and aluminum products remain in effect.
The Global Automakers of Canada has warned the auto tariffs will drive up costs for consumers and impact workers on both sides of the border.

**Summary:** A Nova Scotia veterinarian is speaking out after an outbreak of canine parvovirus among dogs in the Halifax region.
Parvovirus can be highly contagious and has a high mortality rate if left untreated.
Across Atlantic Canada, vaccination standards typically provide the local dog population with high immunity.
But Dr. Dan Maguire says there is now a Halifax outbreak, and several dogs have died.
Pets crossing borders can arrive with different vaccine standards, which could be what brought the virus to the Maritimes.

**Summary:** Premier Doug Ford says a major auto assembly plant in western Ontario must quickly reopen after it announced a two-week shutdown in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs.
Stellantis confirmed it would introduce a temporary shutdown of its auto assembly plant in Windsor, Ont., between April 7 and April 21 after Trump put 25 per cent tariffs on non-U.S. vehicles.
The Windsor Assembly Plant produces the Chrysler Pacifica, Chrysler Grand Caravan, Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Charger Daytona.
Ford said he remained hopeful the shutdown would only last the scheduled two weeks and not lead to job losses.
They’ll be making announcements and we’ll be there to support the auto workers every which way we can,” he said.
