**Summary:** FREDERICTON — A gathering of religious groups from across North America that was supposed to be held this year in Nova Scotia has been postponed indefinitely because of worries over U.S. border policies.
The annual conference of the North American Interfaith Network, which brings together people of various religions, was scheduled to be held in Wolfville, N.S.
But it has been called off after participants said they were not comfortable having to go back and forth across the U.S. border.
“I did not want to put our friends and colleagues from the United States and Mexico in jeopardy because of the current situation.
At first, he was surprised to hear about border concerns, but he said he understands better after hearing of people’s issues re-entering the United States.

**Summary:** HALIFAX — The Nova Scotia government is offering up to $150,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for a shooting last year at an Africville reunion event in Halifax’s north end.
Department of Justice officials say the July 27, 2024, shooting that left five people injured has been added to the major unsolved crimes reward program.
Justice Minister Becky Druhan said the shooting continues to have a serious and heartbreaking impact on the victims, their families, and the wider community.
In July 2024 Halifax police said two men exchanged gunfire near a crowd at the reunion in Africville Park, and five people were shot.
Crowds of people were in the park celebrating the 41st annual reunion of residents of Africville, the historic Black community in the north end of Halifax that was demolished in the 1960s.

**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — Abuse, missing residents, deaths and feces-strewn walls are among the findings in a new auditor general’s report about personal care homes in Newfoundland and Labrador.
Denise Hanrahan’s team looked at privately owned personal care facilities housing seniors and other vulnerable adults, most of which were for-profit enterprises.
“The Liberals owe the seniors in our personal care homes not just an apology, but real accountability for their failures in caring for the seniors of our province,” he said.
More than 4,400 people were living in personal care homes during Hanrahan’s audit, which covered the period from April 2022 to September 2024.
The audit focused on 35 of the approximately 95 personal care homes operating in the province at that time, and Hanrahan’s staff visited 13 facilities in person.

**Summary:** HALIFAX — Even though Canada was left out of the latest round of global U.S. tariffs, premiers in the Atlantic region say economic uncertainty remains and their work to lift existing duties isn’t over.
“We will do whatever it takes to protect Nova Scotians and our economy,” the premier told reporters.
In its 2025-26 budget, the provincial government included a $200-million reserve fund to help businesses affected by foreign tariffs.
Holt said Canada’s apparent reprieve from the latest round of tariffs was the result of months of relationship building with U.S. counterparts.
For example, she said, officials are in conversations with countries in Asia for seafood opportunities and in Europe for other exports.

**Summary:** ST. JOHN’S — A man who says his right to vote was denied in Newfoundland and Labrador’s 2021 election will finally have his day in court.
In a decision released Wednesday, the provincial Supreme Court ordered a trial to begin in June in Whymarrh Whitby’s legal challenge of the province’s pandemic-delayed election four years ago.
It alleges election officials failed to run a vote that was fair, impartial and in compliance with provincial law.
Handrigan’s decision dismissed arguments by Chaulk’s lawyers that the suit should be declared moot because another provincial election is expected this year.
“I really appreciated that the judge understood that the evidence is there, it’s worth having a trial,” Whitby said in an interview Wednesday.

**Summary:** FREDERICTON — New Brunswick’s Crown-owned electric utility says it understands some customers are frustrated with the cost of electricity, but NB Power says it’s unacceptable that some people are turning to threats and violence.

NB Power says employees have reported an increase in physical threats and “verbal assaults.” The utility says no one should feel unsafe while doing their job.
“We understand that some people are frustrated with us and the cost of electricity, but we will never tolerate any form of violence or aggression towards our employees,” the utility said on the X platform.

**Summary:** FREDERICTON — New Brunswick’s police watchdog says an RCMP officer did not commit a criminal offence when they shot and killed an Indigenous man in Elsipogtog First Nation last year.
The Serious Incident Response Team said in its report dated April 1 that the officer had used “reasonable force” against a man who was holding three axes in his hands and was a threat.
The report, written by director Erin E. Nauss, says two RCMP officers responded to a 911 call on Sept. 8, 2024, about a man with weapons who wanted to take his own life.
It says when officers arrived to the eastern New Brunswick community, the man was showing signs of intoxication and threw one of the axes toward the officers.
One of the Mounties shot the man after the other failed to subdue him with a stun gun.

**Summary:** Almost two years after wildfires destroyed 200 structures, including 151 homes, in the western suburbs of Halifax, residents are anxious about the city’s slow progress in creating more ways for them to flee if the flames return.
Buckland and other residents in nearby communities who were interviewed by The Canadian Press say further changes are needed.
She predicted that if fires reached her area, both exits would likely be blocked by blazes, and the main road would be gridlocked.
Davies contacted the Halifax regional council for education, which told her they’d bring her suggestions forward to Halifax’s Emergency Management Office.
The council sent letters to the city’s emergency office last January, but Davies said she’s had no response to her ideas.

## #7 Transfer of baby eel quota to First Nations was unfair, says federal judge

**Summary:** HALIFAX — A Federal Court judge has ruled that the Fisheries Department failed to properly consult commercial baby eel fishers when it transferred about 14 per cent of their quota to First Nations.
The March 28 ruling from Justice Paul Favel says the quota transfer for the 2023 season away from Shelburne Elver Ltd. and South Shore Trading Co. Ltd. was “procedurally unfair.” The companies had sought a judicial review of the department’s quota decision.
Favel said the federal Fisheries Department didn’t engage enough with the two commercial licence holders before it cut their quotas for the 2023 elver season without any compensation.
“The lack of engagement in advance of the 2023 season was procedurally unfair.
Mitchell Feigenbaum, president of South Shore Trading Co. Ltd., said in an emailed statement that his company also intends to seek damages for the Fisheries Department’s reductions of its elver quota.
