**Summary:** There are a number of bills that propose giving the government more control over transportation, universities, and around what qualifies as a legitimate freedom of information request.
NDP Leader Claudia Chender invited journalists to a briefing Thursday where she called on all citizens concerned about “overreach” and the extension of provincial powers to speak out.
Chender had this to say to reporters: These laws will allow the Houston government to restrict information by undermining the information and privacy commissioner.
‘Nova Scotians have been clear’ The legislature is paused for March Break after having met for two weeks.
“When Nova Scotians spoke up against threats to the independence of the Auditor General’s office, the Houston Conservatives were forced to back down,” the NDP caucus said in Thursday’s news release.

**Summary:** Uranium mining Joan Baxter’s latest article looks at the push for uranium mining in Nova Scotia, the myths being promulgated by those who want an end to the uranium ban, and the history of how that ban came to be.
Then with no warning, 16 years later, on Jan. 21, 2025, Premier Tim Houston wrote to his caucus decrying the bans on uranium mining and fracking for onshore fossil gas.
Before that November grant to EverWind, there was US$125 million (now worth C$174.5 million), from Export Development Canada.

**Authors:** Joan Baxter, Philip Moscovitch, Jennifer Henderson, Suzanne Rent

**Published:** 2025-03-13 22:13:03

**Keywords:** radioactive, houston's, reactivated, uranium, mining, nova, scotia, exploration, issue, mans, thomas, nuclear, ban, energy, emerman, report, saskatchewan, province, industry, safety, houston, kirby, inquiry, examiner, public, mines, risks, association, jobs, 1982, health, noted, moratorium, environmental, safe

**Summary:** It’s that long ago that citizens in Nova Scotia first became concerned about the radioactive issue of uranium mining and exploration in Nova Scotia, and mounted an informed and impassioned campaign to have it stopped.
The lawsuit eventually wound up in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and the jury spent five hours deliberating before finding Smyth innocent of libel.
Writes MANS: Nova Scotia had a boom in uranium exploration from approximately 1976 to 1981.
Uranium mining today is very different from what it was four decades ago when Nova Scotia banned it.
To what extent do you support or oppose the mining and exploration of uranium in Nova Scotia?
