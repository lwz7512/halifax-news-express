## Postmedia got $4.2 million in Google money; the Halifax Examiner got $36K

**Authors:** Tim Bousquet

**Keywords:** postmedia, million, google, 36k, halifax, examiner, money, nova, ndp, click, scotia, 00, cricket, search, hate, send, item, copy, rcmp, link, missing, pictou, media, children, county, association, trump, film, crimes, sea, arrives, sails, lake, rescue, pakistan

**Summary:** The Google money helps; $36K is ballpark about half the total annual cost of one reporter.
For readers, I’d like you to have this take-away: the Google money amplifies your subscription money.
The Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service has been engaged.
Still, a film tariff could have big implications for Nova Scotia.
It helps of course that there is a mature film industry in British Columbia, Toronto, and now in Nova Scotia.

**Keywords:** fascism, opportunists, lessons, propagandist, nova, it’s, film, research, scotia, human, dutch, continent, don’t, teunissen, men, political, that’s, send, item, copy, elephants, 12, click, food, province, day, community, issues, link, feed, online, program, 00, past, family

**Summary:** Sure, he joined the party, but all he was trying to do was protect the Dutch film industry and help it grow.
When I saw a recent fundraising letter from Feed Nova Scotia, signed by Avery, I was struck by its tone.
It said that charities such as Feed Nova Scotia should not exist, and that food is not the solution to food insecurity.
Feed Nova Scotia expanded its mandate in 2023 to include creating systemic change.
The program is currently only available in Nova Scotia Health’s Central Zone.
