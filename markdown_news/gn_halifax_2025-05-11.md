**Summary:** Hamas says Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, will be released as part of efforts to establish a ceasefire, reopen crossings into the territory and resume the delivery of aid.
He was abducted from his base during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that ignited the war in Gaza.
Khalil al-Hayyah, a Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group has been in contact with the U.S. administration over the past few days.
The Israeli military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians.
The Israeli military said his remains were recovered from deep inside Syria, without providing further details.

**Summary:** Pope Leo XIV called for a genuine and just peace in Ukraine and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, in his first Sunday noon blessing as pontiff that featured some symbolic gestures suggesting a message of unity in a polarized Catholic Church.
Leo was picking up the papal tradition of offering a Sunday blessing at noon, but with some twists.
Traditionalists and conservatives, many of whom felt alienated by Pope Francis’ reforms and loose liturgical style, have been looking for gestures hinting at Leo’s priorities.
On Sunday Leo wore the simple white cassock of the papacy and had reverted back to wearing his silver pectoral cross.
It is unclear if Leo will move into the apartments or just use them for formal audiences as Francis did.

“Out of those 3,000 kits, there were 120 positives,” said Dr. Todd Hatchette, STI Care Now Medical Director.
We are finding STIs and we are treating those individuals.” Nova Scotia Health’s decision to expand the program to include HIV screening is being done in partnership with the Health Equity Alliance of Nova Scotia.
“Sexual health testing in Nova Scotia capacity-wise has been abysmal for decades.

## #10 Soviet-era spacecraft plunges to Earth after 53 years stuck in orbit

**Summary:** A Soviet-era spacecraft plunged to Earth on Saturday, more than a half-century after its failed launch to Venus.
The European Space Agency’s space debris office also tracked the spacecraft’s doom after it failed to appear over a German radar station.
The chances of anyone getting clobbered by spacecraft debris were exceedingly low, scientists said.
But this one never made it out of orbit around Earth, stranded there by a rocket malfunction.
Much of the spacecraft came tumbling back to Earth within a decade of the failed launch.

## #7 Canadians could stay visa-free longer in U.S. under proposed bill

**Summary:** Canadian snowbirds could stay longer in the United States without a visa if a bill recently proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives becomes law.
The Canadian Snowbird Visa Act, introduced at the end of April, would provide the longer time-frame for those aged 50 and over who both maintain a home in Canada and either own or lease a U.S. residence.
“We’re supporting job growth, strengthening our bond with our closest neighbors, and helping local communities thrive,” said Lee in a statement.
The proposal comes as many Canadians opt not to travel south because of Trump’s ongoing trade war and ongoing threats of annexation, while a lower loonie and rising insurance rates have also pushed Canadian snowbirds to sell their U.S. homes.
The U.S. embassy has said Canadians arriving by air, or those issued an I-94 form at a land border, shouldn’t need to register further.

Two CL-415 firefighting aircraft and their crews will head to Dryden, Ont., while two other of the same aircraft will head to Meadow Lake, Sask.
Quebec’s forest fire prevention agency, known as SOPFEU, says the teams departed Sunday from Quebec City.
The agency says the current situation in Quebec allows for resources to head to other provinces.
Since the season began, the Quebec agency has responded to 59 fires in the province which have ravaged 38.7 hectares of forest.

**Summary:** Voter turnout in last fall’s Nova Scotia election reached a historic low, continuing a downward trend led by the province’s youngest group of voters.
New statistics released this week from Elections Nova Scotia confirm overall voter turnout for the Nov. 26 election dropped to a record-setting 44.9 per cent.
“Declining voter turnout has been a trend in many Canadian jurisdictions,” the report said, adding that similar voter turnout levels were reported in Ontario in 2022 and 2025.
“I also think political parties are not necessarily making it a priority to reach out to younger voters,” Turnbull said.
November’s election in Nova Scotia saw the Progressive Conservatives led by Premier Tim Houston win a second consecutive majority government.

**Summary:** Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday welcomed Russia’s offer for direct peace talks, but insisted there must be a full, temporary ceasefire in place before negotiations can start.
We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire — full, lasting, and reliable — starting tomorrow, May 12th, and Ukraine is ready to meet,” Zelenskyy said.
“An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations,” Macron told reporters at the Polish-Ukrainian border, according to French media.
It said 60 drones were shot down and another 41 simulator drones failed to reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures.
The Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday accused Ukraine of “violating” Moscow’s three-day ceasefire more than 14,000 times.

**Summary:** U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that there was “substantial progress” in the weekend sessions but offered scant details on exactly what negotiations entailed.
Bessent was more cautious in assessing the state of play than was his partner, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy.
The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on countries worldwide, but its fight with China has been the most intense.

**Summary:** Trump intends to convert the Qatari aircraft into a plane he can fly on as president, with the Air Force planning to add secure communications and other classified elements to it.
The existing planes used as Air Force One are heavily modified with survivability capabilities for the president for a range of contingencies, including radiation shielding and antimissile technology.
Air Force One is a modified Boeing 747.
Trump’s family business, the Trump Organization, which is now largely run by his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has vast and growing interests in the Middle East.
That is a departure from Trump’s first term, when the organization released an ethics pact prohibiting both foreign government and foreign company deals.

**Summary:** A Quebec coroner is recommending that diphenhydramine — an antihistamine and sedative sometimes used to sleep better — should be better managed in pharmacies after the overdose death of an 18-year-old man south of Montreal in December 2023.
On the morning of Dec. 11, 2023, the man was found by his mother in his bed, unconscious and laying on his back.
The coroner found the circumstances surrounding the death raise questions about the uncontrolled availability of a potentially lethal over-the-counter substance.
“I cannot understand why the sale of diphenhydramine … is not better controlled,” coroner Vincent Denault wrote.
The coroner noted there were previously used empty jars and blister packs of diphenhydramine tablets in the man’s bedroom.

**Summary:** As Alberta flirts with the possibility of a referendum on separation, Quebec sovereigntists are watching with interest — and a healthy dose of skepticism.
We’re not alike.” Last week, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith tabled legislation that would lower the bar for a citizen petition to trigger a referendum.
Still, Alepin questioned whether Albertans who say they support independence really want to leave Canada, or whether they simply plan to use the threat as leverage.
“Most Albertans, even those that support separation, don’t really want it,” he said.
He said that would be his first choice, even though it would undermine the independence movement.
