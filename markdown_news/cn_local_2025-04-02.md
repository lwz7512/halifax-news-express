**Summary:** Almost two years after wildfires destroyed 200 structures, including 151 homes, in the western suburbs of Halifax, residents are anxious about the city’s slow progress in creating more ways for them to flee if the flames return.
Buckland and other residents in nearby communities who were interviewed by The Canadian Press say further changes are needed.
She predicted that if fires reached her area, both exits would likely be blocked by blazes, and the main road would be gridlocked.
Davies contacted the Halifax regional council for education, which told her they’d bring her suggestions forward to Halifax’s Emergency Management Office.
The council sent letters to the city’s emergency office last January, but Davies said she’s had no response to her ideas.
